# LinearVsBinary
Two arrays are created, both a length of 1000019. 
Array 1's values are incremented 0 to n chronologically. Array 2's values are array 1's values, but reversed.
Both arrays are prompted to find a target value (a random value between 0 to n).

The results and probe comparisons are printed in the terminal.

** SPOILER ALERT ** Binary search is faster for arrays of this size.
